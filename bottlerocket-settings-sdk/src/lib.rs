/*!
This crate provides a Rust SDK for building Bottlerocket Settings Extensions.

TODO: docstring (<https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-settings-sdk/issues/4>)

# Crate Features

By default, all features are enabled; however, the crate allows for disabling types which are used
to build extensions in favor of only providing model definitions. This is useful for cases where a
tool wishes to invoke a settings extension and parse the output.

* **extension** -
  When enabled, this causes the SDK library to expose the `SettingsExtension` type, as well as all
  other utilities required to build a `SettingsExtension` or serve it on the CLI.

* **proto1** -
  When enabled, this allows extensions built against the SDK to serve the Settings Extension CLI
  protocol version "proto1".
